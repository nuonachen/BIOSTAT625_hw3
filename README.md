This is a R package that allows users to fit a linear regression and compute several attributes of the model. These include fitted values, residual, residual standard error, standard errors of coefficients, t scores of coefficients, multiple R squared, adjusted R squared, and F statistic. Users need to put independent variables in a n by m matrix - x, and dependent variable in a n by 1 matrix - y. The functions that compute these values take x and y. Users are also able to print the summary of these values in a table using summary_table(x, y).
